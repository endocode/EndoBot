The EndoBot is a simple jabber chat listener written in Ruby.
It listens to the specified channel and writes all the messages in the output file.
We use a daily scrum report in the chat that looks like this:

    1. What did I do for the client?
    2. What did I do for the company?
    3. Impediments/Help needed
